# These are different routes we can use to communicate over the internat using https protocol
GET # Request data from a specified resource
POST # Create a resource
PUT # Update a resource
DELETE # Delete a resource


# we cant test the post route example through the web browser so we will use a third part application meant for testing apis: Postman
Download and install Postman
click the plus button in Postman to create a new request
copy the local host link you are running the main.py file on into the url box in Postman
before proceeding append '/create-user' to the url
change the method to be POST
select the Body tab
select Raw to send raw data
change the data from Text to json
then in the body pass a javascript object notation object that looks like this:
    {
        "username": "your_name"
    }
then hit send

Your response should be:
    {
        "username": "your_name"
    }

    with a status code of 201, showing that your POST Api request should be working
